# Topic Dynamics in the DFG Research Grants Program: Code Repository

This repository contains the code and scripts used in my Master's thesis, **"Topic Dynamics in the DFG Research Grants Program."** The code implements topic modeling techniques and data analysis methods to explore the evolution of research themes funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG).

## Key Features
- **Methods Implemented:**
  - Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
  - Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
  - Topic Space Trajectories
- **Data:** Extracted from the GEPRIS platform.
- **Languages & Tools:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

## File Structure
- `data/`: Contains sample datasets (if applicable).
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for analysis and visualization.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for interactive exploration.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
